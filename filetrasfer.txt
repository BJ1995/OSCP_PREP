If you have issues with connecting to the SMB share from the Windows machine, setup the SMB server with auth
sudo smbserver.py -username root -password root -smb2support share .

Then you'll have to mount the share
net use Z: \\192.168.45.181\share /user:root root

Finally you'll be able to access the share using cd \\192.168.45.181\share

The reason for this is because some policies disallow guest shares which are shares without auth
